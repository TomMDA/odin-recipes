# Odin-Recipes

Project #1 of The Odin Project, 

Breif was to create a basic website to host recipies, each page has orderd and unorderd lists with a recipie and image of the finished product and a link back to the main page. 

This was after an introduction to HTML, i have previous knowledge of working with HTML and building similar static pages so this was refreshing previous knowledge.

This project will form as a testing ground for CSS testing once i have completd this seciton of the project.
